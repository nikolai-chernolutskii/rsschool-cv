### About
I am a web developer whose passion is to *bring visual ideas to life through coding.* 

With more and more businesses going online, the demand for professionals helping to ensure virtual presence is soaring. My goal is to apply my skills in front end web development towards providing people with websites that are both visually appealing and functional.

How did it all start for me? Well, it’s a dream that I had cherished for a long time but up to a certain moment had never been brave enough to pursue. 

Once an English teacher, a translator, a project manager and a tango instructor, with the start of the pandemic two years ago and a sharp drop in tango classes I realized that this was the exact time to turn a crisis into an opportunity and seek a new career path, allowing me to help people from all over the world. Since then, I have been learning web development and applying my gained knowledge in various projects.

Albeit naive, the ultimate goal I’d like to achieve is to assist people in reaching out to their clients, friends or communities, both locally and globally, through making themselves seen on the Web.

I have a tremendous desire to learn the latest developments in the field of front end development, and I am willing to invest as much effort as will be required to achieve that goal.

In the future I see myself progressing from building websites to web applications through various frameworks, giving more flexible opportunities to respond to my clients’ needs.

My language skills of English and Lithuanian (as well as my native Russian) make verbal communication with the clients easier, whereas my extensive tango background helps to establish non-verbal rapport.
